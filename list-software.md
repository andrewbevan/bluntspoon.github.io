## [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
A lightweight, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft, offering robust features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and extensive support for extensions to customize the development environment.

An AI assistant designed to provide insightful, accurate, and creative support across a wide range of topics. Whether solving technical problems, brainstorming ideas, or creating documentation, it has become an invaluable partner in my day-to-day productivity.
