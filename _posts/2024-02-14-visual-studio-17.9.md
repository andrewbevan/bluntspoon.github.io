Below are two of my favourite new features that were introduced with the recent update to Visual Studio 2022. These kind of improvements are intended to help keep you in the zone and flow of development.

> No more breaking flow just switch tooling so that you can query your endpoints, now you can test them directly from VS.

## 💬 AI Generated Git commit messages

> Use the new generated Git commit message feature to help you describe your set of changes
