Today, I celebrate an incredible milestone: 18 years with [Derivco](https://derivco.com), a global leader in the online gaming industry. Last year, I shared my reflections in my [17-year anniversary post](https://andrewbevan.me/career/2024/01/08/17yrs-at-derivco.html), reflecting on the journey that brought me here. This year has been one of transformation, with major changes that have brought exciting new challenges — and I couldn't be more inspired for what lies ahead.

## Growth Through Change 🔄
This past year has been one of the most dynamic yet. Our organization has undergone significant changes that have reshaped the way we work and the challenges we tackle. While change can be daunting, it has also been an incredible opportunity for growth, innovation, and collaboration.

Adapting to new circumstances has required all of us to think creatively, embrace agility, and push our limits. It has been a privilege to be part of a team that thrives under pressure and rises to the occasion with resilience and determination.

## Facing Big Challenges 💪
With change comes new challenges, and this year has been no exception. Whether it’s navigating complex projects, adopting emerging technologies, or rethinking our processes, the journey has been both demanding and rewarding. These challenges have not only tested my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of teamwork, communication, and adaptability.

This year has brought an exciting shift toward exploring the latest and greatest technologies, particularly in the realm of AI. From integrating machine learning models into our workflows to leveraging AI-powered tools for optimization and innovation, staying at the forefront of technology has been both a challenge and a thrill. The evolving landscape continues to push me to stay sharp, embrace new concepts, and remain a lifelong learner.

## Looking Ahead 🚀
As I step into my 19th year with [Derivco](https://derivco.com), I’m excited about the road ahead. The changes we’ve experienced this year have set the stage for bold innovations and opportunities to make a meaningful impact. I’m committed to embracing the challenges, driving new solutions, and continuing to grow as a software developer and architect.

I’m grateful for the amazing people at [Derivco](https://derivco.com), whose passion and creativity have been the foundation of our success. Together, I’m confident we’ll navigate whatever comes next and achieve even greater things.

## Thank You 🙏
