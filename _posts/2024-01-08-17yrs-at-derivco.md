I joined Derivco on 8th of January 2007 as a junior software quality assurance engineer, fresh out of university and eager to learn. I was fascinated by the dynamic and innovative nature of the online gaming industry, and I was excited to work on cutting-edge technology and challenging projects.

## My Growth 🚀

Over the years, I have worked on many different projects, ranging from casino games, sports betting, and poker. Growing my skills and career. I have had the oppertunity to use various technologies, such as C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Azure and more.

I have also had the privilege of working with many great people in Derivco, who have really pushed me to be the best I can be and have taught many things over my time at Derivco.
